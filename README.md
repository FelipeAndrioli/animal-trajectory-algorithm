#Animal Path Algorithm 

This is my university final project, which I pretends to finish and publish it on a GIS Congress.

##Objective

The main objective of the project, is to create a algorithm to estimate the path of animals which was killed on the roads to find out the reason of this movement.

##Realized and Non Realized Yet Objectives

- ~Get shapefile from MS State vegetations and transform it on a dataframe~
- ~Transform animal's death position into a dataframe and shapefile~
- ~Transform animal's monitoring position into a dataframe and shapefile~
- ~Get the altitude tiff file from MS state~
- ~Do the table of the relationship from Animal Death Position x Vegetation~- Get the altitude average of animal's monitoring position
- Do the MS state square mesh
- Get information of each square from the square mesh
- Do the math theory of the algorithm
- Implements the algorithm
- Plot and compare the results
